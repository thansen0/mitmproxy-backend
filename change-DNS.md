# Change DNS server

So we can use [clean browsing](https://cleanbrowsing.org/filters/) to filter out all adult content and malware, whatever that may mean. By using the adult filter, it won't filter out mixed use sites, which is what we're interested in.

Here's a site that explains it: https://www.linuxfordevices.com/tutorials/linux/change-dns-on-linux. Unfortunately it's not clear to me whether this will work through a server, or if it must be on the host machine, but I can test it.

## Temporary

in `/etc/resolv.conf`, there's currently 

```
# Generated by NetworkManager
nameserver 10.96.0.1
```

Which should be replaced with 

```
# From Clean Browsing
nameserver 185.228.168.10
nameserver 185.228.169.11
```

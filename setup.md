# MITM Proxy Setup

### Proxy Server

Run mitmproxy, and then run this line to open a new browser:

```
chromium --proxy-server="http://localhost:8080"
```

Everything falls into place and it works. The issue is the browser now prevents me from proceeding, which is annoying. Just turned off secure DNS so hopefully that fixes it.

### mitmdump

```
./mitmdump -w writedata.txt
./mitmdump -s save_html.py
```

### TLS passthrough

This will allow all TLS through, while inspecting SSL and http
